# How To Start the Project

If you use `bash` as your terminal (as well as `zsh`, and so on), you should input the following:

```zsh
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

And, if your terminal is `CMD` (for Windows users), your code is:

```CMD
> set FLASK_ENV=development
> flask run
```

If you use `powershell` (alias `pwsh`), your code is:

```pwsh
> $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
> flask run
```
